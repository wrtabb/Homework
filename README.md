# Phys926Homework

This is a repository to hold my homework for Physics 926 and Physics 916. I decided to take the opportunity of being forced to work from home due to the COVID-19 scares to start doing homework assignments in LaTeX.

I found the first template I am using here: https://joshldavis.com/2014/02/12/doing-your-homework-in-latex/
