# Phys926Homework

This is a repository to hold the homework for Physics 926, particle physics, for the last part of the semester.
Due to Coronavirus, classes have been moved online and I decided it was a good idea to start typing out my homework
assigmnets using LaTeX. Keeping this in GitHub is nice because I can track changes as they occur.

I found the first template I am using here: https://joshldavis.com/2014/02/12/doing-your-homework-in-latex/
